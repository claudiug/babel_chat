= Status

- I do not have a list of active users
- I think is possible to save the users in a redis
- on faye, you can
# faye.on(:publish) do |client_id, channel, data|
#   puts "#{client_id} == #{channel} == #{data}"
# end
- data has the username

- also, you can receive a DOS becuase anyone cand send amount of data on the channel. there is no protection
